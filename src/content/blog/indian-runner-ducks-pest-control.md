## History of Indian Runner Ducks:
These ducks originated in the Far East, specifically in the area now known as Indonesia. The ducks were originally bred for their eggs and meat, but over time, they were also utilised for their excellent foraging abilities. These ducks were first imported to Europe in the late 19th century and later to America in the early 20th century.

## Characteristics and Physical Appearance:
They have a distinctive upright posture and a slender body shape. They have long necks and small heads, which makes them look almost like miniature geese. The ducks have a unique gait, which is a result of their upright posture and long legs. They are considered a medium-sized duck breed, with adult males reaching up to 3.5 pounds and adult females reaching up to 2.5 pounds.
They also come in a variety of colours, including white, black, chocolate, blue, and fawn. They have glossy and iridescent plumage, which is a result of the oil gland located at the base of their tail. This oil is spread over their feathers, giving them a waterproof and shiny appearance.

## Personality and Behavioural Traits:
These ducks are known for their calm and docile nature. They are not as vocal as other duck breeds, which makes them great for suburban and urban environments. They are also known to be friendly and curious, which makes them a great addition to any backyard farm or homestead. These ducks are also known for their foraging abilities and are great at keeping a backyard or garden free of pests.

## Care and Maintenance:
Indian Runners are relatively low maintenance when it comes to care and maintenance. They require a clean and spacious area for them to live in, such as a coop or pen. They also need access to clean water and food, as well as a place to swim if possible. It is important to provide a safe and secure area for the ducks to sleep at night, as they are prey animals and are vulnerable to predators.

## Uses of Indian Runner Ducks:
Although primarily used for egg and meat production, they also make great pets. They are known for their excellent foraging abilities and are great at keeping a backyard or garden free of pests. They are also used in pest control in agricultural settings. Additionally, they can be used for duck racing or as exhibition birds.

## Breeding and Incubation:
The females are known to be prolific layers, laying up to 300 eggs per year. They can start laying eggs as early as 6 months of age. Although great egg layers they don’t really go broody, so if you want to hatch little ducklings, you’ll have to incubate them yourself. Egg incubation of duck eggs takes 28 days and needs constant temperature and humidity. You also need to spray the eggs with lukewarm water daily and turn the eggs every two hours to prevent the embryo from getting stuck to the shell. Hatching your own ducklings are exhilarating.
