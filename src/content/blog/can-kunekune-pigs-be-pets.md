## Honestly, can a pig be a pet?

Yes, Kunekune pigs can make good pets for the right kind of owner. Kunekune pigs are a small breed of pig that is known for their friendly and social personalities. They are generally very docile and are known to be good with children and other pets, such as dogs. And they love belly rubs. See the video below of my 18-week-old Kunekune boy called Sonny. His girl is 20 weeks old and named Cher. It seemed original at the time and I’m sure Sonny and Cher won’t mind it a bit.

## Important things you should know.
However, it’s important to note that Kunekune pigs are still pigs, requiring a lot of care and attention. 

They need a lot of space to move around, and they can be quite messy animals. Any animal can be aggressive and dangerous if not properly bred or socialised, so please be wary of all animals.

## Ok, so now you want one?

I know they are super cute and so cool but if you’re considering getting a Kunekune pig as a pet, it’s essential to do your research and make sure you’re prepared for the commitment. 
You should also check local laws and regulations to ensure that keeping pigs as pets in your area is legal. 

Additionally, it’s important to find a reputable breeder or rescue organization that can provide you with a healthy and well-socialized pig.
